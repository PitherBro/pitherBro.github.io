<p>What is <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/submission/974/Pither%2C+pithering">Pithering</a>? a bit like piddling, but <strong>not</strong> <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline;">always</span>  playing.</p>

    **Disclaimer**

<p>
I am not much of an HTML monkey,<br>
but I love to play with Python and know how to setup a basic HTML site,
<br>
along with some easy enough CSS styling and Javascript logic. <br>
Take a peak at my code and enjoy the simplisity and neatness of it's arrangement. <br>

Further History
</h2>
I first began my coding journey as a <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Batch_Scripting">Batch</a> writter to simplify the launching of games, web links, and game fixes that I glued together on Windows, simple stuff.

<p>Later on when I had to further my education, I sought out the classic route of obtainng a collage degree. I soon persued my pasion in computers as a Computer Science Major, yearning to understand the complextites of the softwares and the underpinnings of their inner workings.</p>
<p>
I could hardly then, as well as even now, understand how complex the field of Computer Science is, and just how numerous the rabbit holes were that I would diving into.
Luckily I was able to hide behind the excuse of being a Computer Science Tutor, which brought it's own mirraid of distresses and discoveries. Mainly being a good to reinforce the subjects I had already learned, and learn from people who had a diffreent perspective on their approach to this never ending journey.
</p>

<p>
Overall I am not afraid to admit that my college experince could not prepare me for the ever evolving world of computers,
from the time I started college to the end. The World of AI went from a theoritical exploritory field of loose documentations to a much more cohesive and applicable at home hobby.
In the same token, many technologies went from their early wobbly stages(Belender,Unity, Unreal) to the more refined powerhouses we see in the industries today.
