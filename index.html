<p>What is <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/submission/974/Pither%2C+pithering">Pithering</a>? a bit like piddling, but <strong>not</strong> <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline;">always</span>  playing.</p>

<p>
I am not much of an HTML monkey,<br>
but I love to play with Python and know how to setup a basic HTML site,
<br>
along with some easy enough CSS styling and Javascript logic. <br>
Take a peak at my code and enjoy the simplisity and neatness of it's arrangement. <br>

Further History
</h2>
I first began my coding journey as a <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Batch_Scripting">Batch</a> writter to simplify the launching of games, <br>
web links, and game fixes that I glued together on Windows, simple stuff.

<p>Later on when I had to further my education, I sought out the classic route of obtainng a collage degree. <br>
I soon persued my pasion in computers as a Computer Science Major, yearning to understand the <br>
complextites of the softwares and the underpinnings of their inner workings.</p>
<p>
I could hardly then, as well as even now, understand how complex the field of Computer Science is,<br>
and just how numerous the rabbit holes were that I would diving into.
<br>
Luckily I was able to hide behind the excuse of being a Computer Science Tutor, <br>
which brought it's own mirraid of distresses and discoveries. <br>
Helping to reinforce the subjects I had already learned, <br>
and learn from people who had a diffreent perspective on their approach to this never ending journey of discovery.
</p>

<p>
Overall I am not afraid to admit that my college experince could not prepare me for the exponentialy evolving world of computers,<br>
from the time I started college (2015) to the end (2020) (i like to learn my studies). <br>
The World of AI went from a theoritical exploritory field of loose documentations <br>
to a much more cohesive and applicable at home hobby. <br>
In the same token, many technologies went from their early wobbly stages ( <span title="Way better than it deserves to be"><a href="https://www.blender.org/features/">Belender</a></span>, <span title="A kind satan"><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unity-has-apologized-for-its-install-fee-policy-and-says-it-will-be-making-changes-to-it">Unity</a></span>, <span title="An impressive engine, complicated, but impressive"><a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5">Unreal</a></span> ) to the more refined powerhouses we see in the industries today. 
</p>
<p>
    Personally I would suggest the ever growing <a href="https://godotengine.org/features/">Godot</a> for all it's kinship to Blender when it comes to Game Programming or even simple applications( <a href="https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/859/what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-to-using-a-game-engine">be careful though</a> )
